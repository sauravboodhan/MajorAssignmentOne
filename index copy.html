        <h3>Surrealism Origins</h3>
        <p>The Surrealist art movement began in the late 1910s, originating during a War-torn world.
            The artists of this moevement sought to liberate their minds & human experiance from
            the oppression of rationalism & reality. With this, the art pieces produced by
            some notable artists of this time have explored the subconcious, flamboyant, mysterious,
            and often, if not, fantastical elements of one's creativity.
